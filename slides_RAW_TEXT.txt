Hybrid Model - Consulting + SaaS Security Solutions
● Scoring Matrix:
○ Training & Certifications: 7/10 (profitable but competitive market).
○ Subscription Security Model: 8/10 (high potential but requires investment).
○ Hybrid Approach: 9/10 (balanced between service & product scalability).
Automated Security Solutions – Over time, automating security functions via SaaS can reduce
manual consulting hours, leading to higher margins.
Continuous Innovation – SaaS platforms can be regularly updated with new security features,
ensuring clients stay protected against evolving threats.
Long-Term Contracts – Clients who start with consulting are more likely to sign multi-year SaaS
agreements for ongoing protection.
Scalability – Once developed, the software can be sold repeatedly without significant additional
costs, increasing profit margins.
